## Security & Privacy (Plain-English)

These are the most common security questions answered directly:

- **This is a local desktop tool**: it does not require a separate cloud account for this project, and it does not rely on a project-hosted cloud account storage.
- **Data is mainly stored on your machine**:
  - `~/.antigravity_cockpit`: Antigravity accounts, configs, WebSocket status, etc.
  - `~/.codex`: official Codex current login `auth.json`
  - `~/.gemini`: Gemini Cli local session files (for example `oauth_creds.json`, `google_accounts.json`, `settings.json`)
  - local app data folder under `com.antigravity.cockpit-tools`: Codex / GitHub Copilot / Windsurf / Kiro / Cursor / Gemini Cli / CodeBuddy / CodeBuddy CN / Qoder / Trae / Zed multi-account index data, etc.
- **WebSocket is local-only by default**: binds to `127.0.0.1`, default port `19528`; you can disable it or change the port in Settings.
- **When network access happens**: OAuth login, token refresh, quota fetching, update checks, and other official API requests.
- **Practical safety tips**:
  1. If you do not need plugin integration, disable WebSocket.
  2. Do not share your full user directory directly; redact token files before backup/share.
  3. On shared/public computers, remove accounts and quit the app after use.

## Settings Guide (Beginner Friendly)

If you want a stable setup with minimal tuning, follow the "Recommended" values.

### General Settings

| Setting | What it does (simple) | Recommended | When to change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Display Language | Changes UI language | Your native/comfortable language | Only if current language is hard to read |
| Theme | Light/dark appearance | System | Use dark mode for long night sessions |
| Window Close Behavior | What happens when clicking close | Ask every time | Choose "Minimize to tray" if you want background running |
| Antigravity Auto Refresh | Periodically updates Antigravity quota | 5-10 minutes | Use 2 minutes if you need near real-time updates |
| Codex Auto Refresh | Periodically updates Codex quota | 5-10 minutes | Same as above |
| GitHub Copilot Auto Refresh | Periodically updates GitHub Copilot quota | 5-10 minutes | Same as above |
| Windsurf Auto Refresh | Periodically updates Windsurf quota | 5-10 minutes | Same as above |
| Kiro Auto Refresh | Periodically updates Kiro quota | 5-10 minutes | Same as above |
| Cursor Auto Refresh | Periodically updates Cursor quota | 5-10 minutes | Same as above |
| Gemini Cli Auto Refresh | Periodically updates Gemini Cli quota | 5-10 minutes | Same as above |
| CodeBuddy Auto Refresh | Periodically updates CodeBuddy quota | 5-10 minutes | Same as above |
| CodeBuddy CN Auto Refresh | Periodically updates CodeBuddy CN quota | 5-10 minutes | Same as above |
| Qoder Auto Refresh | Periodically updates Qoder quota | 5-10 minutes | Same as above |
| Trae Auto Refresh | Periodically updates Trae quota | 5-10 minutes | Same as above |
| Zed Auto Refresh | Periodically updates Zed quota | 5-10 minutes | Same as above |
| Data Directory | Where account/config files are stored | Keep default | Only for troubleshooting or backups |
| Antigravity/Codex/VS Code/Windsurf/Kiro/Cursor/Gemini Cli/CodeBuddy/CodeBuddy CN/Qoder/Trae/Zed/OpenCode App Path | Manually set executable path | Leave empty (auto-detect) | Change only if auto-detect fails or you use custom install paths |
| Auto-restart OpenCode on Codex switch | Sync OpenCode auth after Codex switch | ON if you use OpenCode; otherwise OFF | Enable for frequent Codex switching with OpenCode |

Notes:
- Smaller refresh intervals mean more frequent requests.
- If quota-reset wake-up tasks are enabled, some minimum refresh limits may apply (UI will show hints).

### Network Settings

| Setting | What it does (simple) | Recommended | Risk / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WebSocket Service | Real-time local integration for plugins/clients | OFF if not needed | Still local-only (`127.0.0.1`) when enabled |
| Preferred Port | Listening port for WebSocket | Default `19528` | Change only on conflict; restart required after save |
| Current Running Port | The actual active port | Read-only info | May differ if preferred port is occupied |

### 3 Ready-to-Use Presets

1. **Stable default**: 10-min refresh, WebSocket OFF (if no plugin), keep default paths.  
2. **Frequent switching**: 2-5 min refresh, WebSocket ON if needed, OpenCode sync ON.  
3. **Security-first**: WebSocket OFF, do not share user directory, remove unused accounts regularly.

## Installation Guide

### Option A: Manual Download (Recommended)

Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/releases) to download the package for your system:

*   **macOS**: `.dmg` (Apple Silicon & Intel)
*   **Windows**: `.msi` (Recommended) or `.exe`
*   **Linux**: `.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `.AppImage` (Universal)

### Option B: Install with Homebrew (macOS)

> Homebrew is required.

```bash
brew tap jlcodes99/cockpit-tools https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools
brew install --cask cockpit-tools
```

If you hit the macOS "App is damaged" warning, you can also install with `--no-quarantine`:

```bash
brew install --cask --no-quarantine cockpit-tools
```

If Homebrew says the app already exists (e.g. `already an App at '/Applications/Cockpit Tools.app'`), remove the old app and install again:

```bash
rm -rf "/Applications/Cockpit Tools.app"
brew install --cask cockpit-tools
```

Or force overwrite the existing app:

```bash
brew install --cask --force cockpit-tools
```

### Option C: Arch Linux (AUR)

Install via an AUR helper such as `yay` or `paru`:

```bash
# Source-built package
yay -S cockpit-tools

# Prebuilt binary package
yay -S cockpit-tools-bin
```

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

#### macOS says "App is damaged and can't be opened"?
Due to macOS security mechanisms, apps not downloaded from the App Store may trigger this warning. You can quickly fix this by following these steps:

1.  **Command Line Fix** (Recommended):
    Open Terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Cockpit Tools.app"
    ```
    > **Note**: If you changed the app name, please adjust the path in the command accordingly.

2.  **Or**: Go to "System Settings" -> "Privacy & Security" and click "Open Anyway".
