---
## [0.14.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **CodeBuddy CN platform full integration**: Added CodeBuddy CN models, commands, modules, OAuth flow, account pages, services, stores, icons, navigation, dashboard/tray wiring, and multi-instance management support.
- **CodeBuddy CN account lifecycle support**: Added browser-based OAuth login, Token/JSON import, local client import, account switching with local credential injection, tag management, and account export.
- **Manual OAuth callback URL input**: OAuth flows that rely on a local callback port now support manual callback URL input when automatic callback capture is unavailable, improving authorization success in restricted network environments.

### Changed
- **CodeBuddy/CodeBuddy CN quota display simplified**: Quota information is now viewed on the web page; removed complex in-app quota query form for a cleaner account page experience.
- **Shared runtime surfaces now cover eleven platforms**: Dashboard, tray, settings, quick settings, auto-refresh scheduling, quota-alert preferences, navigation, and README/docs now include CodeBuddy CN consistently.

### Fixed
- **Qoder import now refreshes account list**: JSON and Token import on Qoder platform now correctly refresh account data after successful import, fixing display issues where imported accounts were not shown immediately.
- **Local import now refreshes tray summaries across multiple platforms**: Antigravity, Codex, Cursor, Kiro, Windsurf, Trae, and Qoder now update the tray menu immediately after successful local import, preventing shared-runtime summaries from staying stale after import.

---
## [0.13.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Qoder platform full integration across backend and frontend**: Added Qoder models, commands, modules, official CLI device-login flow, local/JSON import, account pages, services, stores, icons, navigation, dashboard/tray wiring, and raw-plan/quota presentation.
- **Qoder account switching and multi-instance management**: Added Qoder credential injection, default-instance binding, isolated multi-instance profiles, start/stop/open-window/close-all controls, and launch-path detection for macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Trae platform full integration across backend and frontend**: Added Trae models, commands, modules, OAuth flow, local/JSON import, account pages, services, stores, icons, navigation, dashboard/tray wiring, and plan/usage presentation.
- **Trae account switching and multi-instance management**: Added Trae local auth write-back using the client's actual on-disk rules, default-instance binding, isolated multi-instance profiles, start/stop/open-window/close-all controls, and launch-path detection for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

### Changed
- **Shared runtime surfaces now cover ten platforms**: Dashboard, tray, settings, quick settings, auto-refresh scheduling, quota-alert preferences, navigation, and README/docs now include Qoder and Trae consistently.
- **Settings now expose Qoder/Trae path and quota controls**: General settings now cover Qoder/Trae auto-refresh, launch paths, and quota alerts in one place.
- **Gemini platform wording is now aligned as Gemini Cli**: Shared navigation, settings, and account-management labels now consistently use `Gemini Cli`.

### Fixed
- **Pending OAuth sessions are now cancelled when dialogs or pages close**: Provider OAuth flows now cancel in-flight authorization sessions on modal close, tab switch, or page unload to avoid stale pending sessions.
- **Windows updater now keeps installer type consistent to avoid duplicate desktop shortcuts**: Windows update checks now pass an explicit updater target based on the current bundle type (`windows-*-nsis` / `windows-*-msi`), and merged `latest.json` now points the `windows-x86_64` fallback to NSIS to prevent installer-type drift from recreating desktop shortcuts during update.

---
## [0.12.3] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **macOS permission prompts no longer attribute to Cockpit Tools**: All IDE launches (Codex, VS Code, CodeBuddy) on macOS now use `open -a` via LaunchServices instead of direct binary execution, so macOS TCC permission dialogs (e.g. Downloads folder access) correctly attribute to the launched IDE rather than Cockpit Tools. Multi-instance PID tracking is preserved through post-launch process polling.

---
## [0.12.2] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Linux package installs now support managed in-app updates**: Added `.deb`/`.rpm` runtime detection, signed package download, progress reporting, and privileged install flow so Linux package-manager installs can complete updates directly in Cockpit.
- **Antigravity accounts now support local account groups**: Added local folder-style account groups on the Antigravity accounts page, including create/rename/delete, batch add/remove, grouped browsing, and per-group quota refresh.

### Changed
- **Windsurf plan presentation now recognizes more official tiers**: Windsurf account cards, badges, and filters now resolve Trial, Teams, Teams Ultimate, and Pro Ultimate labels from remote plan data and teams-tier metadata.
- **Linux updater behavior now matches package-managed installs**: Background silent download is skipped for managed `.deb`/`.rpm` installs, and the sidebar/update dialog now shows authorization and installation progress states during one-click update.
- **Quota alert native notifications now follow the selected UI language**: Backend notification text now resolves from locale keys and covers Codex, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro, Cursor, Gemini, and CodeBuddy consistently.

### Fixed
- **Wakeup task creation/test now checks runtime readiness first**: Opening “new task” and “test task” now stops early and reuses the existing runtime-path guidance when the wakeup runtime is not configured.
- **Settings and recovery dialogs now surface action failures inline**: Quick Settings path/config errors, file-corruption “open folder” failures, and global modal action failures are now shown in the UI instead of only logging to console.
- **macOS quota alerts no longer keep a click-wait notification loop alive**: Native quota notifications now use fire-and-forget delivery to avoid unnecessary background energy usage after notification delivery.

---
## [0.12.1] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Codex account profile hydration from official account-check endpoint**: Added a `refresh_codex_account_profile` backend/frontend flow to fetch and persist `account_name` and `account_structure`.
- **Automatic profile hydration for team-like Codex accounts**: Added store-level background hydration for accounts missing structure/name metadata, with in-flight de-duplication and a 5-minute retry interval.

### Changed
- **Codex account cards and tables now display account context**: account rows now show “Personal account” or hydrated team/workspace names based on structure, plan type, and workspace metadata.
- **Codex instance quota preview now follows Code Review visibility preference**: when Code Review quota is hidden in preferences, instance-page badges, search text, and quota preview now hide it consistently.

---
## [0.12.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **CodeBuddy platform full integration across backend and frontend**: Added CodeBuddy models, commands, modules, OAuth flow, account pages, services, stores, icons, navigation, dashboard wiring, and shared platform metadata.
- **CodeBuddy account lifecycle support**: Added browser-based OAuth login, Token/JSON import, quota query and binding, cycle/resource/extra-credit presentation, tag editing, bulk actions, account export, and local credential injection for account switching.
- **CodeBuddy multi-instance management**: Added CodeBuddy instance store and commands with isolated user-data directories, account binding, instance create/update/delete, start/stop, open-window, and close-all controls.
- **CodeBuddy quota binding supports full cURL replay**: Added a full `Copy as cURL (bash)` workflow for `get-user-resource`, replaying the original request (method/headers/body) to improve binding accuracy and persist normalized quota binding parameters.

### Changed
- **CodeBuddy is now integrated into shared runtime surfaces**: Added CodeBuddy app-path detection, auto-refresh interval, quota-alert settings, Quick Settings, tray summaries, and global refresh scheduling.
- **Cursor switch now attempts to launch the default instance after injection**: switching a Cursor account now updates the default-instance binding and tries to start Cursor immediately, while still emitting unified path-missing guidance when the app path is unavailable.
- **Codex quota presentation is now consolidated into one flexible column**: the Accounts table now renders all quota windows in a single area, and Code Review quota visibility can be toggled from preferences.

### Fixed
- **Codex account switching now respects `CODEX_HOME`**: Codex auth file read/write now honors custom `CODEX_HOME` (including quoted env values), and auth write errors now include explicit target paths for troubleshooting.
- **Secondary windows no longer inherit main-window close interception**: non-main windows now close directly instead of being incorrectly blocked by the tray/minimize confirmation flow.
- **Windsurf safe-storage key lookup is now provider-specific**: macOS and Linux credential handling no longer falls back to generic VS Code safe-storage entries, reducing wrong-key reads during injection.

---
## [0.11.3] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- **Gemini OAuth app identity now matches official Gemini CLI**: Gemini authorization now uses the official Gemini CLI OAuth client credentials, so the consent page aligns with `Gemini Code Assist and Gemini CLI` instead of legacy app identity.
- **Gemini web OAuth callback flow now aligns with official behavior**: the browser auth URL uses the official parameter set (without extra `prompt=consent`), and callback handling now redirects to the official Gemini success/failure pages.

---
## [0.11.2] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **Antigravity default-instance custom launch args now take effect**: launching the default Antigravity instance now parses and passes saved `extra_args` to the actual process start command.
- **Remote debugging launch flags can now be applied from Cockpit settings**: flags such as `--remote-debugging-port=9333` are no longer silently dropped in the default-instance start path.

---
## [0.11.1] - 2026-03-08

### Changed
- **Gemini import now validates token state immediately**: JSON import and local `~/.gemini` import now trigger a post-import token refresh, so account metadata is synchronized right after import.
- **Gemini refresh state is now persisted on every outcome**: refresh failures now write `status=error` plus `status_reason` to the account record, and successful refreshes clear the error status.

### Fixed
- **Gemini refresh failures no longer stay as log-only signals**: failed manual or batch refresh attempts are now persisted to account status fields for consistent UI visibility.

---
## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- **Gemini platform full integration across backend and frontend**: Added Gemini models/commands/modules/OAuth on Tauri side, plus account pages, services, stores, icons, navigation, and platform metadata wiring on frontend.
- **Gemini account lifecycle support**: Added OAuth login, Access Token/JSON import, local `~/.gemini` import, quota refresh, tag management, account export, and local credential injection for account switching.
- **Gemini multi-instance management**: Added Gemini instance store/commands with default and custom profile directories, account binding/injection, launch command generation, and one-click terminal execution.
- **Gemini settings and runtime integration**: Added `gemini_auto_refresh_minutes`, Gemini quota-alert enable/threshold config, and integrated Gemini into Settings, Quick Settings, auto-refresh scheduler, dashboard, and tray/runtime surfaces.
- **Gemini docs and i18n coverage**: Updated README (EN/ZH) and locale keys for Gemini overview, instance workflows, switching, importing, and flow notices.

### Changed
- **Post-switch UX now supports provider-specific success actions**: `useProviderAccountsPage` now exposes an inject-success callback; Gemini overview uses it to open a launch-command modal immediately after switching.
- **Gemini launch semantics aligned with default-instance behavior**: Default-instance launch command now uses plain `gemini`; custom instances keep `GEMINI_CLI_HOME=... gemini`.
- **Gemini launch modal wording updated for generic use**: Launch dialog title now uses “Launch Instance” instead of a multi-instance-specific label.
- **Gemini instance UI simplified to match actual CLI behavior**: Removed runtime-state/PID/stop expectations in Gemini instance list and aligned default-instance edit behavior with real launch semantics.
- **Shared platform/presentation pipeline expanded for Gemini**: Added Gemini to shared platform typing/navigation/meta and unified Gemini account plan/quota presentation in reusable account view helpers.

---
## [0.10.1] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **Cursor platform end-to-end integration**: Added full Cursor account and multi-instance support across backend commands/modules, frontend pages/stores/services, side navigation, tabs, dashboard cards, and tray integration.
- **Cursor account management capability set**: Added OAuth (PKCE), Token/JSON import, local `state.vscdb` import, account export, and account injection back to Cursor profile data for switching.
- **Cursor quota and subscription pipeline**: Added official refresh chain (`usage-summary`, `GetUserMeta`, Stripe profile endpoints), including Total/Auto/API/On-Demand metrics and team-limit parsing.
- **Cursor settings and automation wiring**: Added Cursor app path, auto-refresh interval, and quota-alert enable/threshold in both Settings and Quick Settings, and integrated Cursor into global auto-refresh.
- **Cross-platform existing-directory instance mode**: Added `existingDir` initialization mode for Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf/Kiro/Cursor to register existing local directories as instances.
- **Fingerprint preview autofill support**: Added preview-current-profile autofill/writeback for missing fields and frontend field-level auto-generated indicators.

### Changed
- **App framework now includes Cursor globally**: added Cursor routing/page mounting, dashboard current/recommended account card actions, platform typing/navigation expansion, and platform metadata wiring.
- **System tray startup and rendering path was upgraded**: tray now boots with a lightweight skeleton menu first and asynchronously loads full account-driven menus; Cursor tray summaries and platform ordering are included.
- **Startup blocking work was reduced**: settings merge and log cleanup were moved to background threads; i18n startup preloads `en` resources and uses an explicit loading shell before app mount.
- **Settings/Quick Settings/config schema expanded**: added `cursor_auto_refresh_minutes`, `cursor_app_path`, `cursor_quota_alert_enabled`, and `cursor_quota_alert_threshold`, with backward-compatible config normalization.
- **Instance workflow enhancements across providers**: Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf/Kiro/Cursor now validate and support `existingDir` creation mode in backend and frontend forms.
- **Codex account presentation expanded**: added auth metadata parsing (`Signed in with <provider>`, ID details) and a dedicated Code Review quota metric in cards/tables.
- **Plan/tier badge styling unified**: introduced shared `--plan-*` design tokens and switched account/instance pages to common badge color mapping.
- **Localization coverage was expanded for new Cursor flows**: updated locale keys across supported language packs for Cursor pages, OAuth/import flow, `existingDir` instance mode, quick settings, and quota display copy.

### Fixed
- **Provider account dedup correctness improved**: GitHub Copilot and Windsurf now deduplicate by `github_id`; Kiro avoids email-only merges when `user_id` presence conflicts.
- **Kiro account deduplication issue fixed**: Fixed the Kiro account merge path (`b045e1e2`) where different user identities could be incorrectly merged under the same email and cause account overwrite.
- **Fingerprint preview data consistency improved**: reading current profile now autofills missing fingerprint fields, returns generated-field markers, and attempts writeback to storage.
- **Path-missing guidance chain now covers Cursor fully**: `APP_PATH_NOT_FOUND:cursor` is handled by unified set/reset/detect/retry flow.

---
## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **Cursor platform end-to-end integration**: Added full Cursor account and multi-instance support across backend commands/modules, frontend pages/stores/services, side navigation, tabs, dashboard cards, and tray integration.
- **Cursor account management capability set**: Added OAuth (PKCE), Token/JSON import, local `state.vscdb` import, account export, and account injection back to Cursor profile data for switching.
- **Cursor quota and subscription pipeline**: Added official refresh chain (`usage-summary`, `GetUserMeta`, Stripe profile endpoints), including Total/Auto/API/On-Demand metrics and team-limit parsing.
- **Cursor settings and automation wiring**: Added Cursor app path, auto-refresh interval, and quota-alert enable/threshold in both Settings and Quick Settings, and integrated Cursor into global auto-refresh.
- **Cross-platform existing-directory instance mode**: Added `existingDir` initialization mode for Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf/Kiro/Cursor to register existing local directories as instances.
- **Fingerprint preview autofill support**: Added preview-current-profile autofill/writeback for missing fields and frontend field-level auto-generated indicators.

### Changed
- **App framework now includes Cursor globally**: added Cursor routing/page mounting, dashboard current/recommended account card actions, platform typing/navigation expansion, and platform metadata wiring.
- **System tray startup and rendering path was upgraded**: tray now boots with a lightweight skeleton menu first and asynchronously loads full account-driven menus; Cursor tray summaries and platform ordering are included.
- **Startup blocking work was reduced**: settings merge and log cleanup were moved to background threads; i18n startup preloads `en` resources and uses an explicit loading shell before app mount.
- **Settings/Quick Settings/config schema expanded**: added `cursor_auto_refresh_minutes`, `cursor_app_path`, `cursor_quota_alert_enabled`, and `cursor_quota_alert_threshold`, with backward-compatible config normalization.
- **Instance workflow enhancements across providers**: Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf/Kiro/Cursor now validate and support `existingDir` creation mode in backend and frontend forms.
- **Codex account presentation expanded**: added auth metadata parsing (`Signed in with <provider>`, ID details) and a dedicated Code Review quota metric in cards/tables.

- **Path-missing guidance chain now covers Cursor fully**: `APP_PATH_NOT_FOUND:cursor` is handled by unified set/reset/detect/retry flow.

---
## [0.9.17] - 2026-03-06

### Changed
- **Windows Codex path reset detection is now Store-first and drive-aware**: Path reset now scans `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\OpenAI.Codex_*\app\Codex.exe` and `<Drive>:\WindowsApps\OpenAI.Codex_*\app\Codex.exe` across drives, selects the highest package version, and falls back to Appx `InstallLocation\app\Codex.exe` when direct scan misses.
- **Startup auto app-path probing was removed**: The app no longer runs automatic app-path detection during startup; path detection now runs on explicit reset or launch-missing-path flows.
- **Announcement delivery remains non-intrusive**: New announcements continue to use unread badge indication and no longer force-open the detail modal.

### Fixed
- **Windows Codex default launch now works with configured path**: Added Windows default-instance launch flow for Codex so launch/switch-triggered start can execute when `codex_app_path` is configured.
- **Instance actions no longer stay disabled after stop**: After stopping an instance, row actions are re-enabled in-place without requiring page navigation refresh.
- **Restored macOS Codex multi-instance behavior after 0.9.16 regression**: Reverted the 0.9.16 Codex single-instance restriction impact on macOS, restoring multi-instance launch/control flow to the v0.9.15 behavior baseline.
- **Restored Codex PID recognition on macOS instance rows**: Brought back instance-home-based process matching so running Codex instances can be identified and displayed with PID correctly.

---
## [0.9.16] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Windows Codex desktop control management**: Added first-class Windows support for Codex desktop process control, including launch, stop, focus, and restart flow (close first, then reopen).
- **Windows Codex auto path detection for Store installs**: Added Appx-based path detection via `OpenAI.Codex` `InstallLocation\\app\\Codex.exe`, so Cockpit can resolve Codex executable path in Microsoft Store installation scenarios.

### Changed
- **Announcement delivery is now non-intrusive by default**: New announcements no longer force-open the detail modal; unread items are indicated by the red badge only and are opened manually from Announcement Center.
- **Codex account identity display is now compact and single-line**: Codex account cards/tables now show `Signed in with <provider> | Account ID: <id>` in one line, and workspace name is removed from default account identity display to reduce UI noise.
- **Codex code review quota label is fixed to English**: The code review quota metric now always uses `Code Review` as the display label.
- **Windows Codex control model aligned to official single-instance lock**: Codex multi-instance is now explicitly marked unsupported on Windows/macOS in Codex instance management, with clear UI/backend reason text, and operations are constrained to single-instance control semantics.

---
## [0.9.15] - 2026-03-04

### Changed
- **Release publication now waits for full pipeline completion**: The release workflow now creates draft releases first and only marks them as `latest` after matrix builds, merged updater `latest.json`, checksum upload, and Homebrew cask update all succeed. This prevents in-app update prompts from appearing before release artifacts are fully ready.

---
## [0.9.14] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- **Floating sidebar quick-update action**: Added a compact action above the sidebar that follows updater lifecycle states (`Update` / `Downloading %` / `Restart`), so users can continue update flow without reopening settings pages.

### Changed
- **Updater retry and failure handling hardened**: Added retry-with-backoff plus retryable/non-retryable error classification for update check/download, with retry status feedback and sanitized error details in UI/logs.
- **Update check baseline interval changed to 1 hour**: Default update-check interval is now 1 hour, and legacy 6h/24h interval values are migrated to 1 hour automatically when settings are loaded.
- **macOS process probe path for desktop clients was switched to `ps`-first matching**: Antigravity/VS Code/Codex/Kiro/Windsurf process discovery now prioritizes command-line probing and keeps app-root path comparison, reducing protected-directory touches while improving process match stability for instance operations.
- **Antigravity macOS multi-instance startup behavior was tightened**: Non-default instances now launch via `open -n` without `--reuse-window`, and startup includes a short PID resolve polling window (up to 6s) for the target `user-data-dir`.
- **Codex quota refresh now synchronizes plan metadata back to account index**: `plan_type` is now synced from refreshed `id_token` and quota usage response into account summary index, so subscription badges can update without re-import.

### Fixed
- **Reopened update dialog now preserves prepared-update restart state**: If the same version is already downloaded, reopening the update dialog now stays in `Ready to restart` state instead of falling back to `Update now`.
- **Manual dialog restart now reuses unified apply-update pipeline**: `Restart now` in the update dialog now follows the same install/relaunch path as silent updates, preventing state divergence between update entry points.
- **GitHub Copilot instance injection no longer fails on macOS due to wrong Safe Storage key priority**: VS Code/Copilot injection now prefers Code-family Keychain entries before Antigravity entries, preventing `AES-CBC decryption failed: Unpad Error` when decrypting existing `github.auth`.

---
## [0.9.13] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- **Pending update notes local cache for post-restart changelog**: Added persisted `pending_update_notes.json` storage so downloaded update notes can be shown after restart without requiring online changelog fetch.

### Changed
- **Update check source is now fully unified to Tauri Updater metadata**: Removed backend GitHub Releases API polling for version detection; update availability now comes from updater endpoint metadata (`latest.json`) only.
- **Manual/silent update note rendering now reads updater release body**: Update dialog and silent-update pre-cache now parse bilingual sections directly from updater `notes`, while keeping browser-download fallback only for updater failures.

---
## [0.9.12] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- **Background auto update mode (zero-intervention)**: Added a `Settings > General > Background Auto Update` option. When enabled, the app checks updates normally, downloads new packages silently in the background, and prompts restart when the update is ready.
- **Post-update changelog popup on version jump**: Added startup version-jump detection based on locally recorded `last_run_version`. After an upgrade, the app now shows a “What’s New” dialog for the current version.
- **Silent update ready toast with restart action**: Added a bottom-right update toast after background download, with `Later` and `Restart` actions.

### Changed
- **Desktop updater pipeline migrated to Tauri Updater**: Integrated updater/process plugins and enabled updater artifacts + release endpoint config, so in-app update flow uses signed updater metadata.
- **Manual update dialog now supports in-app download/install progress**: The update modal now performs in-app update with progress/status/error display and falls back to opening the GitHub release page when updater flow fails.
- **Update settings persistence behavior was hardened**: Auto-update preference loading/saving now avoids first-render overwrite and only writes when user change or explicit state change is confirmed.
- **Update-related i18n coverage expanded across locale packs**: Added update toggle/progress/restart/version-jump translation keys in all supported locales.

---
## [0.9.11] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- **Fixed Windows switch/start crashes on non-ASCII install paths**: Windows extended-path normalization now uses Unicode-safe prefix handling, preventing `byte index is not a char boundary` panics on non-ASCII paths.

### Changed
- **Verification default model selection now prioritizes Flash**: In “Run check now”, the default model now selects the first option whose display name contains `flash` (case-insensitive), and falls back to the first available model when no match exists.

---
## [0.9.10] - 2026-03-02

### Changed
- **Official-aligned wakeup execution stability**: Extended official LS startup wait to 60s, aligned client-gateway trajectory polling window to 60s, and switched `app_data_dir` to an official-style IDE-level directory (`antigravity`, overridable by `AG_WAKEUP_OFFICIAL_LS_APP_DATA_DIR`).
- **Wakeup gateway error-handling flow now mirrors long-running cascade behavior**: When trajectory status remains `RUNNING`, intermediate `errorMessage` steps are treated as transient and polling continues before final fail/success decision.
- **Antigravity plan badge rendering unified across account surfaces**: Centralized tier badge mapping via `getAntigravityTierBadge` and reused it in Accounts and verification detail surfaces.
- **Instance account selector ordering now follows Accounts sorting across all platforms**: Account dropdown ordering in multi-instance views now reuses each platform’s Accounts sort logic (Antigravity / Codex / GitHub Copilot / Windsurf / Kiro), avoiding cross-page ordering drift.
- **Accounts sort preferences are now persisted for all platforms**: Sort field and sort direction in all account pages now persist to local storage and are restored after restart.
- **Instances list sort preferences are now persisted per platform**: Instance list sort field (`createdAt` / `lastLaunchedAt`) and direction now persist by app type, so restart no longer resets instance list sorting.

### Fixed
- **Temporary upstream failures now self-retry once in wakeup path**: `temporary`/HTTP 5xx style payloads from `AG_WAKEUP_ERROR_JSON` now trigger a delayed one-time retry before returning failure.
- **Wakeup verification detail now shows backend user-facing error message**: Detail list now renders `lastMessage` (with truncation), so messages like `Agent execution terminated due to error.` are visible.
- **Wakeup tasks now respect privacy masking for account emails**: Masking is now applied in task cards, test selectors, history rows, and copied debug text.

---
## [0.9.9] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **Built-in User Manual page**: Added a new `manual` page with scenario-based sections (quick start, dashboard, provider accounts, multi-instance, fingerprints, wakeup/verification, settings, and import/export + troubleshooting), keyword search, and expand/collapse controls.
- **One-click manual entry points across key pages**: Added manual shortcuts to dashboard/header areas and account empty states (Antigravity, Codex, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro) to reduce first-run friction.

### Changed
- **Manual page now supports direct action shortcuts**: Each section can jump directly to related pages (Dashboard, Antigravity, Codex, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro, Multi-Instance, Fingerprints, Wakeup Tasks, Verification, Settings), and can open Platform Layout from the guide.
- **Manual localization coverage expanded across locale packs**: Added `manual.*` keys and `nav.manual` labels across all supported locale files to keep guide/navigation copy consistent in multi-language environments.

### Fixed
- **Fixed permission-prompt attribution to Cockpit when launching third-party apps on macOS**: When launching Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf/Kiro from Cockpit, protected-directory permission prompts are now significantly less likely to be attributed to Cockpit.

---
## [0.9.8] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- **Refactored AccountsPages across 4 platforms (Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf/Kiro)**: Introduced `useProviderAccountsPage` plus shared data extraction utilities to consolidate shared state/actions and reduce duplicated page logic.
- **Unified export UX across account pages**: Added `ExportJsonModal` + `useExportJsonModal`, aligned multi-account/single-account export flows, and added download-directory open capability permissions for the export modal flow.
- **Standardized OAuth copy and tab naming across locales**: Updated add-account OAuth labels/description copy to consistently use “OAuth Authorization”.
- **OAuth post-login now performs best-effort refresh**: Added post-login refresh passes for Antigravity quota and GitHub Copilot/Windsurf/Kiro token snapshots to reduce stale data right after authorization.
- **Path-missing guidance now carries retry context**: App-path guidance payload now supports `switchAccount` / `default` / `instance` retry intents so path save can continue the original user action.
- **Wakeup behavior switched to strict no-fallback mode**: Wakeup execution now requires explicit `project_id`; model fetch no longer falls back to hardcoded lists; scheduler no longer uses `fallback_times` outside the time window.
- **Instance window operation semantics tightened**: “Open instance window” now reports focus failures directly instead of auto-starting new processes.
- **Account identity matching is stricter**: Removed email-only merge fallback in Antigravity/Codex account matching paths; Codex-to-OpenCode auth payload now uses persisted `account_id` only.
- **Token parsing/refresh rules tightened for Windsurf/Kiro**: Windsurf token import accepts only API key or Firebase JWT formats; Kiro refresh now fails explicitly when refresh cannot be performed (no snapshot fallback).
- **Command trace pipeline added and made opt-in**: Added trace points for command EXEC/RESULT/SPAWN paths and kept it disabled by default unless `COCKPIT_COMMAND_TRACE=1`.
- **Quick settings quota-alert controls were componentized**: Extracted duplicated quota-alert UI logic into a shared rendering path in quick settings.

### Fixed
- **Launch-path validation now runs before switch/start execution**: When path is missing/invalid, backend returns `APP_PATH_NOT_FOUND:*` before stop/inject/restart actions.
- **Windows focus flow no longer hits `$PID` overwrite errors**: Focus scripts switched to a dedicated PID variable and retry loop for non-zero `MainWindowHandle` before calling focus APIs.
- **Windows executable-path matching reliability improved**: Added normalization for extended path prefixes (`\\?\`, `\\?\UNC\`), environment expansion, command-line exe extraction fallback, and sysinfo fallback diagnostics for path probe misses.
- **Path-missing guidance modal now matches settings visual style**: Reused quick-settings/settings shared styles for consistent title/path section/icon/typography/layout behavior.
- **Fixed Rust warnings in backend integration paths**: Cleaned warning points in token model and wakeup gateway reserved code paths so refactor branch warnings stay controlled.

---
## [0.9.7] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- **macOS repeated privacy permission prompts suppressed**: Replaced broad `sysinfo` process refresh (which fetched `cwd`/`environ`/`root` for all processes) with targeted `ProcessRefreshKind` requests that only retrieve `exe` and `cmd`. This prevents sysinfo from touching protected directories on other processes and eliminates the repeated Music/Photos/Documents permission dialogs on macOS.

### Changed
- **Kiro/Windsurf quota cycle reset time now shows relative + absolute format**: `formatKiroResetTime` rewritten to output `Xd Xh (MM/DD HH:mm)` style, consistent with other platform reset time displays. Sub-day granularity now shows hours/minutes instead of rounding to days.
- **Kiro/Windsurf cycle remaining time shows hours when under 24 hours**: Quota cycle remaining text now switches to `Resets in Xh` when less than one day remains, instead of showing `0 days`.
- **Kiro dashboard card quota display simplified**: Removed redundant used/total and left lines from the Kiro mini-card in Dashboard; now shows `resetText` or `cycleText` directly, consistent with Windsurf card layout.

---
## [0.9.6] - 2026-02-28


### Changed
- **Unified account presentation pipeline across five platforms and multiple entry pages**: Added a shared presentation layer for display name, plan label (raw value), quota metrics, reset text, and usage summaries, and reused it in Dashboard, Accounts, and Instances pages (Antigravity / Codex / GitHub Copilot / Windsurf / Kiro) to avoid multi-place divergence.
- **Token import UX now provides concrete input examples**: Updated token/JSON placeholder copy across locales and added token-format helper styling to improve readability in add/import modals.

### Fixed
- **Antigravity tray quota lines now follow group settings**: Tray submenu now aggregates by configured display groups (including model alias compatibility), so tray output matches grouped quota cards instead of raw per-model lines.
- **Tray refresh now reacts immediately to group-setting updates**: Saving/changing/deleting/reordering groups triggers tray menu refresh without requiring restart/manual cache actions.
- **Re-added accounts can reuse previous fingerprint binding after deletion**: Added deleted-account fingerprint binding persistence and lookup, so delete/re-add flows preserve original fingerprint association when available.
- **Antigravity plan badge display is now unified to normalized tiers**: Instance/account surfaces now consistently show `PRO/ULTRA/FREE/UNKNOWN` instead of mixed raw subscription-tier strings.
- **Antigravity token example helper copy now fully uses i18n keys**: Removed hardcoded Chinese labels in the token example panel so locale switching stays consistent.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- **Windows wakeup no longer pops black terminal windows**: Added hidden-process flags for official Language Server startup and Windows CLI probes (`netstat`, `where.exe`) used by wakeup-related flows.
- **Local wakeup gateway intermittent transport failures now self-recover once**: Added local health-check preflight, transport error classification, and one-time gateway cache rebuild retry for recoverable local connection/TLS/timeout failures.
- **Local gateway requests now bypass system proxy and use a canonical loopback address**: Gateway/official-LS local clients now enforce `no_proxy`, and loopback base URLs are normalized to `127.0.0.1` to reduce proxy/interception-related failures.

### Changed
- **Verification copy and action labels switched from “Verify” to “Detect” across all locales**: Added/used `wakeup.verification.actions.runCheckNow`, updated run-hint wording, and aligned the verification-page primary CTA/title.
- **GitHub Copilot instances quota row now includes Premium requests**: Instance account quota summary now shows Inline, Chat, and Premium usage percentages together.

---
## [0.9.4] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- **Linux `.deb` blank/white window rendering on some environments**: Disabled transparent window by default (`transparent: false`) and added Linux WebKitGTK fallback (`WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` when unset) to improve render stability.
- **Windows account-switch flow could hang while probing Antigravity processes**: Added a 5-second timeout for PowerShell process probing and automatic fallback to `sysinfo` scanning to avoid blocking the switch path.
- **Switch-success but launch-failure now becomes user-visible**: If account data is switched but launching Antigravity fails, backend now returns an explicit error message so frontend can show a visible failure notice.
- **Official LS resolution now follows configured Antigravity app path on all desktop OSes**: Wakeup/verification now derive LS from `antigravity_app_path` on Windows/macOS/Linux (with platform-specific extension/bin path and filename priority), and return unified `APP_PATH_NOT_FOUND:antigravity` when missing so existing path-setup guidance is triggered before execution.

---
## [0.9.3] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- **AppImage blank-page rendering on Linux (including Arch) caused by absolute asset paths**: Vite build output now uses relative asset paths (`base: "./"`), so packaged AppImage can resolve frontend JS/CSS correctly.

### Changed
- **Release-process documentation aligned to current completion rule**: Updated `docs/release-process.md` to treat `remote branch + remote tag` as release completion, while GitHub Actions/asset publishing remains a post-release async step.

---
## [0.9.2] - 2026-02-27

### Changed
- **Windows wakeup/verification now prechecks runtime readiness before execution**: Added a frontend + backend preflight gate so wakeup test and batch verification validate official LS readiness first, instead of failing after request dispatch.
- **Official LS path resolution now derives from configured Antigravity app path on Windows**: Runtime now resolves LS from the configured `antigravity_app_path` (`resources/app/extensions/antigravity/bin`), with deterministic filename priority and fallback matching in the same bin directory.

### Fixed
- **Path-missing guidance now triggers before wakeup starts**: When Antigravity app path or LS binary is unavailable on Windows, the existing `app-path-missing` flow is triggered immediately, preventing late 500 errors from gateway startup.

---
## [0.9.1] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Announcement system (desktop)**: Added a full announcement pipeline with Tauri commands, frontend store/service/types, and announcement center UI (list/detail modal, unread badge, mark-read, refresh, popup, image preview, and action handling for tab/url/command).
- **Announcement source controls for dev testing**: Added local override support (`~/.antigravity_cockpit/announcements.local.json`) and debug workspace source (`announcements.json`) for `npm run tauri dev` testing, with persisted read-state/cache files.
- **Repository announcement seed file**: Added a repository-level `announcements.json` with a welcome announcement and feedback action for quick local debugging and remote source alignment.

### Changed
- **Remote-first announcement strategy for normal users**: Non-dev/runtime builds now skip local override files and use remote announcements (with cache/fallback) by default.
- **Dashboard header action area**: Replaced the dashboard date display with an inline `Announcement` action button; announcement entry is now shown in dashboard context instead of global full-page placement.
- **v0.9.0 announcement content is now fully localized**: Added/filled title, summary, body, and action copy for all 17 supported languages in `announcements.json`, so users see localized announcement content per language environment.
- **GitHub Copilot usage rendering alignment (dashboard + tray)**: Switched usage parsing to structured snapshot semantics (`completions` / `chat` / `premium_interactions`), added `Included` handling, and added a `Premium` metric line/dimension in both dashboard cards and tray summaries.
- **Locale and copy coverage for announcement/tray semantics**: Added `announcement.*` keys across all locale files and extended tray copy mapping with `Included` and GitHub Copilot metric labels (`Inline` / `Chat` / `Premium`).

---
## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Dedicated Antigravity account verification workspace**: added model-based batch account verification with live progress, persisted verification history, per-batch detail view, and status filters (`All` / `Success` / `Verification required` / `Failed`).
- **Official-aligned wakeup/verification transport**: added a `local gateway + official Language Server protocol` flow using `StartCascade` / `SendUserCascadeMessage` / `GetCascadeTrajectory` / `DeleteCascadeTrajectory` for wakeup conversations and account verification runs.
- **403 verification quick actions**: verification-required results now expose validation URL and actions (`Verify now`, copy validation URL, copy debug info) for self-service verification.

### Changed
- **Unified model-list rule across wakeup surfaces**: wakeup task model picker, verification picker, and quota-related model display now all derive from official `agentModelSorts[].groups[].modelIds`; when unavailable, fallback is limited to the fixed 6 recommended models.
- **Antigravity model grouping reduced to 3 groups**: default display groups are now `Claude / Gemini Pro / Gemini Flash`; `Gemini Image` group and legacy mapping are removed to avoid duplicate group rendering.
- **Verification-page UX and privacy alignment**: added batch selection/deletion flow, closable notices, and privacy-toggle-linked email masking consistent with the Accounts page.
- **GitHub Copilot (VS Code semantics) display alignment**: `individual` plans are now normalized to `PRO`; usage is derived from `quota_snapshots.completions/chat/premium_interactions`; cards and tables now include a `Premium requests` dimension with `Included` display support.
- **Wakeup custom-time interaction refinement**: custom time keeps a `time picker + quick input` interaction; empty state no longer shows a default time value; custom time input is now applied to next-run preview and task save even if `Add` is not clicked.

---
## [0.8.13] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- **Independent Dock icon visibility setting (macOS only)**: Added a `Hide Dock icon` option in Settings > General so Dock icon visibility can be controlled separately from close/minimize behavior.
- **Localization coverage for macOS window-behavior options**: Added translation keys for `minimizeBehavior` and `hideDockIcon` settings across supported locales.

### Changed
- **macOS window-behavior config model split**: Added persistent `minimize_behavior` and `hide_dock_icon` fields in local config and wired them through Tauri system commands and WebSocket config updates; startup now applies the Dock activation policy from saved config.
- **Tag edit modal visual polish (especially dark theme)**: Improved dark-theme background, borders, chip/remove-button styling, and input/placeholder/disabled states.
- **OAuth auth URL parameter cleanup**: Removed `include_granted_scopes=true` from generated OAuth authorization URLs.

### Fixed
- **macOS Dock visibility now updates immediately after saving settings**: Changing the Dock icon visibility option now reapplies the macOS activation policy without requiring an app restart.
- **Language-switch config saves preserve new macOS window fields**: WebSocket language updates now keep `minimize_behavior` and `hide_dock_icon` when writing config, avoiding accidental resets.

---
## [0.8.12] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **One-command GitHub Release + Homebrew Cask publisher**: Added `scripts/release/publish_github_release_and_cask.cjs` and `npm run release:github-and-cask` to build a `universal.dmg`, upload assets to GitHub Release, and update `Casks/cockpit-tools.rb` (with `--skip-build` / `--skip-gh` / `--skip-cask` / `--dry-run` support).

### Changed
- **Startup app-path detection strategy**: On startup, the app now loads local config first, probes only platforms without configured paths, and staggers detection calls with a small delay to reduce bursts of system path-detection commands.
- **Release-process docs expanded for Homebrew flow**: Updated `docs/release-process.md` with recommended `universal` build flow, checksum generation examples, GitHub CLI/Rust target prerequisites, and cask update ordering notes.
- **Release workflow restores automatic Homebrew Cask updates**: `release.yml` now restores the `update-homebrew-cask` job to compute `sha256` from the published `*_universal.dmg`, update `Casks/cockpit-tools.rb`, and open a cask PR after release assets are available.
- **Auto-merge is limited to generated cask PRs only**: The release workflow now enables auto-merge only for Homebrew cask PRs created on `automation/update-cask-v*` branches (squash + delete branch), without affecting normal PRs.

### Fixed
- **Windows black console flashes during startup**: Fixed unhidden `cmd /c reg query` calls in the VS Code registry fallback path detection flow. Background commands now run hidden, reducing startup black-window flashes for some Windows users.
- **Brand names and plan/tier labels incorrectly localized**: Restored original brand/product names and raw plan labels in non-English locales, including `Cockpit Tools`, `Antigravity`, `Codex`, `GitHub Copilot`, `Windsurf`, plus `accounts.tier.*`, `codex.plan.*`, and `kiro.plan.*`.
- **Locale-check false positives for brand names**: Added brand-name allowlist entries to the locale validation script so English brand strings are not flagged as missing localization.

---
## [0.8.11] - 2026-02-22

### Changed
- **Antigravity quota backend fetch flow aligned with Antigravity.app**: Unified Cloud Code base URL selection for `loadCodeAssist` / `onboardUser` / `fetchAvailableModels` (Antigravity-style routing), passed `cloudaicompanionProject` through backend requests, and switched `onboardUser` to operation polling (`POST` + `GET`, 500ms poll interval). Local quota API cache is still retained, while the pre-cache backend flow is aligned.

---
## [0.8.10] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Windsurf email/password account import**: Added an `Email & Password` tab in Windsurf Add Account modal and wired Firebase sign-in flow to create local Windsurf accounts.

### Changed
- **Windsurf credits semantics aligned with monthly quota**: `availablePromptCredits` / `availableFlexCredits` are now treated as monthly total quota, and remaining credits are computed as `total - used`.
- **Password handling in sign-in flow**: Email is still normalized with trim, while password now keeps the original input (no trim) to avoid altering valid credentials.

### Fixed
- **Windsurf password-login i18n coverage**: Added missing `windsurf.addModal.password` and `windsurf.password.*` translation keys across locale files to prevent fallback language leakage.
- **Password-login log privacy**: Removed plain email output from Windsurf password-login logs to reduce PII exposure.

---
## [0.8.9] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Account card tags are now visible across all five platforms**: Account tags now render directly on grid cards in Antigravity, Codex, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and Kiro for faster visual identification.

### Changed
- **Card tag display is unified**: Tag chips now follow a consistent compact rule across platforms (show up to 2 tags with `+N` overflow).

### Fixed
- **Release checksum upload workflow no longer depends on local git checkout**: Added explicit `GH_REPO` context for `gh release` calls in the checksum upload job to avoid `fatal: not a git repository` failures.

---
## [0.8.8] - 2026-02-21

### Changed
- **Codex quota windows now follow window presence**: Codex quota rendering is now driven by `primary_window` / `secondary_window` presence instead of always forcing two fixed lines.
- **Codex window labels now use Codex-style rules**: Window labels now use unified dynamic formatting (`5h`, `Weekly`, `Xd`, `Xh`, `Xm`) based on actual window minutes.
- **Multi-instance Codex account selector now shows plan badge**: Bound-account dropdown/list in Codex instances now shows subscription badges (`FREE/PLUS/PRO/TEAM/ENTERPRISE`) alongside account emails to reduce free-plan ambiguity.
- **Manual update check now always shows feedback**: Clicking `Check Updates` now shows loading state and explicit result feedback (`up to date` / `check failed`) instead of silent no-op when no new version is found.
- **Release workflow now auto-publishes checksums**: GitHub Release pipeline now automatically generates and uploads `SHA256SUMS.txt` from release assets, removing manual checksum upload.

### Refactored
- **Shared Codex quota-window helper introduced**: Codex account page, dashboard cards, and Codex instances now reuse the same window-label/window-visibility helper to keep display logic consistent.

---
## [0.8.7] - 2026-02-21

### Changed
- **Unknown-tier rendering and filtering added**: Accounts with missing subscription tier now resolve to `UNKNOWN` (instead of falling back to `FREE`) in cards/tables, and the account filter dropdown now supports `UNKNOWN` as a dedicated option.
- **Unknown badge now uses warning styling**: `UNKNOWN` tier badges are highlighted in red to visually distinguish tier-identification anomalies from normal `FREE` accounts.
- **Quota modal badge consistency**: Quota details modal now always shows a tier badge, including `UNKNOWN` when subscription tier is unavailable.

### Fixed
- **No stale tier carry-over after refresh**: Removed backend behavior that preserved previous `subscription_tier` when the new quota payload had no tier, preventing old `PRO/ULTRA` labels from persisting incorrectly.
- **Tier-identification diagnostics improved**: Subscription identification logs now emit explicit `UNKNOWN` failure reasons (including status/body snippets and loadCodeAssist context) to distinguish API errors from successful responses without tier data.

---
## [0.8.6] - 2026-02-21

### Changed
- **Model group auto-classification now ignores version suffixes**: Added prefix/pattern matching for model families so Claude and Gemini variants are grouped by family (Pro/Flash/Image) even when exact IDs are not pre-listed.
- **"Other Models" cleanup for Claude/Gemini variants**: Claude Sonnet/Opus variants and Gemini x Pro/Flash/Pro Image variants are now routed into their target default groups instead of falling into `Other Models`.
- **Default Gemini group labels renamed**: Group display names were updated from `G3-Pro`, `G3-Flash`, `G3-Image` to `Gemini Pro`, `Gemini Flash`, `Gemini Image` for version-agnostic naming.

### Fixed
- **Legacy group-name compatibility**: Existing saved group settings with legacy `G3-*` names are automatically migrated to the new Gemini labels on load.

---
## [0.8.5] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **Kiro account ban detection**: Automatic detection of suspended/banned Kiro accounts. When the quota refresh API returns a ban signal (e.g. 403 FORBIDDEN), the account is automatically marked as `banned` with the reason stored.

### Changed
- **Banned account UI**: Account cards and table rows now show a 🔒 `forbidden` status badge and a greyed-out card style to visually distinguish banned accounts.
- **Banned account action restrictions**: The switch button is disabled for banned accounts; the dashboard recommendation algorithm and quota alert suggestions automatically exclude banned accounts.
- **Bulk refresh skips banned accounts**: Refresh-all now skips accounts already marked as banned, reducing unnecessary API calls, and logs the skipped count.
- **Quota alert excludes banned current account**: If the currently active account is banned, quota alert checks are skipped.

### Fixed
- **Error vs. ban state separation**: Refresh failures (`error`) and account bans (`banned`) are now recorded separately, preventing all refresh errors from being misclassified as generic errors.

---
## [0.8.4] - 2026-02-19

### Changed
- **Kiro JSON import now supports raw account snapshots**: The import pipeline now accepts Kiro-style raw JSON objects (and arrays) with fields like `accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `expiresAt`, `provider`, `profileArn`, and `usageData`, then maps them into normalized local accounts.
- **Kiro import parser is unified with OAuth snapshot mapping**: JSON import now reuses the same snapshot-to-payload extraction path as OAuth/local import, improving consistency of email/user/provider/plan/quota field parsing.

### Fixed
- **Slash datetime parsing for imported expiry**: Kiro token expiry values in `YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm:ss` format (e.g. `2026/02/19 02:01:47`) are now parsed correctly during import.
- **Bonus expiry fallback coverage**: `freeTrialExpiry` is now recognized as a fallback source when deriving Kiro add-on expiry days.

---
## [0.8.3] - 2026-02-18

### Changed
- **Tray platform matrix expanded with Kiro**: Added Kiro to tray platform ordering/display and account-count aggregation, and introduced Kiro account summary rendering in tray menus (plan + prompt/add-on remaining with reset time).
- **Legacy tray layout compatibility for Kiro rollout**: When loading old four-platform tray configs, Kiro is auto-appended only for legacy default layouts while preserving user-customized visibility/order.
- **Raw plan/tier labels enforced in account pages**: Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf account cards, tables, and filter options now show original plan/tier values directly (no localized remapping).

### Fixed
- **Auto-switch threshold boundary**: Account auto-switch trigger now fires when remaining percentage is less than or equal to threshold (`<=`) to avoid missing boundary cases at exact threshold.

---
## [0.8.2] - 2026-02-18

### Changed
- **OAuth callback server hardening**: Rewrote the local OAuth callback server to loop over incoming requests, silently ignoring non-callback requests (e.g. favicon), and only processing the actual `/oauth-callback` path. Added CORS preflight (OPTIONS) support and an explicit 404 response for unmatched routes.
- **OAuth CSRF protection**: OAuth authorization URL now includes a `state` parameter generated per flow; the callback server validates the returned state to prevent cross-site request forgery.
- **OAuth flow timeout & cleanup**: Added a configurable timeout for the OAuth callback wait; on timeout or failure the flow state is automatically cleaned up, and a user-facing retry message is returned.
- **OAuth redirect host normalization**: Changed OAuth redirect URI from `127.0.0.1` to `localhost` for broader browser/OS redirection compatibility.
- **Account identity matching overhaul**: Replaced the previous email-only account matching with a strict multi-factor identity matcher (`session_id` → `refresh_token` → `email + project_id`), plus a legacy single-email fallback for backward compatibility during upsert.
- **Google user ID persistence**: OAuth `UserInfo` now parses and stores the Google `id` field, writing it into account data on login completion.

---
## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-17

### Changed
- **Plan/Tier labels now use raw values**: Account-card and table badges across Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf/Kiro now display original backend/local plan values directly, while keeping existing style mapping.
- **Overview tabs use fixed default labels**: Platform overview tabs (`Account Overview` / `Multi-Instance`) now render default text directly to avoid cross-locale mismatch from platform-specific translation overrides.
- **Platform names are fixed to source labels**: Shared platform label rendering now always shows original platform names (`Antigravity`, `Codex`, `GitHub Copilot`, `Windsurf`, `Kiro`).
- **Codex switch behavior is configurable**: Added `codex_launch_on_switch` to backend/user config and wired it into Settings and Quick Settings so switching Codex can optionally skip auto launch/restart.

### Fixed
- **Dashboard privacy consistency**: Dashboard account emails are now masked by the same privacy toggle used in account/instance pages, with focus/visibility/storage sync to keep masking state consistent.
- **OpenCode switch-token sync reliability**: Fixed a regression where GPT account switching did not effectively replace OpenCode login credentials in runtime scenarios, causing the app session to stay on the previous account. (#51)
- **Dashboard card layout balance**: Fixed the Antigravity account card width behavior to avoid obvious right-side whitespace in dashboard layouts and improve visual balance. (#49)

---
## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **Fifth platform is live**: Kiro officially joins the supported platform lineup with unified management alongside Antigravity, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf.
- **Core Kiro flows are now available**: OAuth/Token/JSON/local import, account switching, quota refresh, multi-instance lifecycle, and app path configuration are all included.
- **Platform-layer refactor**: Instance services, account stores, and overview tabs were unified into reusable platform abstractions to reduce future integration cost.
- **Key fixes in this release**: Hardened Kiro import ID validation against path traversal and filled missing locale keys to reduce mixed-language fallback in non-default locales.

---
## [0.7.3] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Tray platform layout persistence**: Added backend tray layout config storage (`tray_layout.json`) and command `save_tray_platform_layout` to save tray visibility, order, and sort mode.
- **Tray visibility control in layout modal**: Added `Show in tray` toggle in platform layout management and synchronized the related locale key across supported languages.
- **Expanded tray platform coverage**: Added GitHub Copilot and Windsurf tray submenus with account/quota summary and direct navigation targets.

### Changed
- **Tray menu architecture**: Refactored tray menu generation to dynamic multi-platform rendering, supporting auto/manual ordering and overflow grouping (`More platforms`).
- **Tray refresh trigger points**: GitHub Copilot/Windsurf refresh, OAuth completion, token import, and account switch flows now refresh tray content immediately; language changes also trigger tray rebuild.
- **Frontend tray event handling**: `tray:refresh_quota` now refreshes Antigravity, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf in one flow; tray navigation now recognizes `github-copilot` and `windsurf`.
- **Platform layout sync strategy**: Added debounced frontend-to-backend tray layout sync on reorder/visibility changes and on initial app load.

### Fixed
- **Tray visibility filtering correctness**: Fixed tray platform filtering so disabled platforms remain hidden and the empty-state item appears when no tray platform is selected.
- **Log privacy hardening**: Logger now masks email addresses in log messages to reduce exposure of sensitive identifiers.

---
## [0.7.2] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Group management "Other Models" bucket**: Added an auto-collected `Other Models` group that lists non-default models discovered from account quotas.
- **Auth-mode model blacklist filtering**: Added blacklist filtering by model ID/display name in group management to exclude blocked Gemini 2.5/chat variants.
- **Claude Opus 4.6 mapping coverage**: Added `claude-opus-4-6-thinking` and `MODEL_PLACEHOLDER_M26` to default/recommended model mappings and wakeup recommendations.

### Changed
- **Group settings migration behavior**: Loading group settings now incrementally backfills missing default mappings/names/order while preserving user custom configuration.
- **Group modal data source**: Accounts page now passes live model IDs/display names into group management, improving model label display and "other model" classification accuracy.
- **Model display order alignment**: Account quota display order was aligned to include Claude Opus 4.6 under the Claude group.

### Fixed
- **Locale completeness for group settings**: Synchronized `group_settings.other_group` across all supported locales to avoid missing-key fallbacks.

---
## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Cross-platform quota alert workflow**: Added quota alert calculations and event dispatch for Antigravity, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf, with per-platform model/credit metric detection.
- **Quota alert settings surface**: Added quota alert enable/threshold controls in both Settings and Quick Settings, with synchronized i18n keys.
- **Global modal infrastructure**: Added reusable global modal store/hook/component (`useGlobalModal` + Zustand + `GlobalModal`) for cross-module prompts and alert actions.
- **Notification capability integration**: Integrated Tauri notification capability in app runtime/capabilities with macOS click-to-focus handling.

### Changed
- **Quota refresh behavior**: Refresh-all and refresh-current flows for Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf now trigger quota-alert checks after successful quota/token refresh.
- **Alert payload model**: `quota:alert` payload now carries `platform`, and the frontend modal quick-switch action now routes to the correct platform switch flow/page.
- **Settings input interaction**: Refresh interval and threshold controls now use preset + inline numeric input mode with Enter/blur apply behavior.
- **Config model propagation**: `quota_alert_enabled` and `quota_alert_threshold` are now persisted through command save/get and websocket language-save paths.
- **Log retention policy**: Logger initialization now cleans up expired `app.log*` files older than 3 days.

### Fixed
- **Quota alert listener lifecycle**: Prevented duplicate `quota:alert` subscriptions caused by async unlisten timing in React effect cleanup.
- **Threshold consistency at 0%**: Runtime threshold normalization now honors `0%`, matching frontend options and user expectations.

---
## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- **Full Windsurf platform integration**: Added Windsurf account system end-to-end, including OAuth/Token/Local import, account persistence, quota sync, switch/inject/start flow, and multi-instance commands.
- **Windsurf frontend modules**: Added Windsurf account page, instance page, service/store/type layers, and dedicated icon/navigation assets.
- **Dashboard support for Windsurf**: Added Windsurf statistics and overview cards with quick refresh/switch actions, aligned with existing platform cards.
- **Platform layout capability**: Added layout management modal and platform layout store for platform ordering/visibility management in navigation.

### Changed
- **Navigation structure expansion**: Side navigation and routing were extended to include Windsurf and platform-layout entry points.
- **Settings model extension**: General settings now include Windsurf auto-refresh and app-path controls, plus corresponding quick-settings behavior.
- **Windows path detection pipeline**: App detection was upgraded with stronger multi-source probing, PowerShell `-File` fallback, and VS Code registry probing.

### Fixed
- **Path detection reliability on Windows**: Improved handling for empty/error-prone command output and reduced false-miss cases during VS Code/Windsurf path discovery.
- **Quota refresh fallback behavior**: Failed refresh now preserves the last valid quota snapshot to avoid clearing displayed quota to zeros.
- **Switch/injection robustness**: Improved handling and diagnostics around account binding and startup path mismatch cases.

---
## [0.6.10] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **Privacy mode for screenshots**: Added Eye/EyeOff toggle and masking for email-like identifiers in Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot account overviews and instance pages.
- **GitHub Copilot one-click switching pipeline**: Added default-profile VS Code switching path with token injection and restart integration.
- **Cross-instance window focus/open support**: Added and localized `openWindow` action and improved focus behavior by PID for Antigravity/Codex/VS Code instances.
- **Quota/switch diagnostics**: Added richer runtime logs and metadata outputs for refresh/switch troubleshooting.
- **Codex multi-team identity support**: Added account matching based on `account_id`/`organization_id` to support multi-team scenarios.
- **macOS distribution postflight hook**: Added Cask postflight logic to auto-remove quarantine attributes.
- **Release process templates/scripts**: Added release checklist/docs and helper scripts for preflight validation and checksum generation.

### Changed
- **Unified switch flow (overview -> default instance)**: Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot overview switching now follows default-instance startup logic (PID-targeted close -> inject -> start).
- **GitHub Copilot flow alignment**: Overview switching and multi-instance startup now share the same injection/start semantics.
- **Instance lifecycle alignment**: Unified start/stop/close behavior across Antigravity/Codex/VS Code with managed-directory matching and PID tracking.
- **Windows VS Code launch strategy**: Switched to `cmd /C code` for `.cmd` wrapper compatibility.
- **PID resolution semantics alignment**: VS Code PID resolving/focus now uses `Option<&str>` semantics (`None` => default instance), matching Antigravity behavior and reducing default-instance mismatch edge cases.
- **Docs and settings guidance**: Updated README/security/settings guidance for new switching and path behaviors.
- **Localization synchronization**: Updated locale keys across all supported languages for Copilot switching, open-window action, privacy mode, and related error messages.

### Fixed
- **Error compatibility and messaging**: Improved non-success status handling paths and user-facing error propagation for refresh/switch operations.
- **PR review follow-ups**: Improved error handling, added SQLite transaction safeguards in injection flow, and fixed branding inconsistencies.
- **Build hygiene**: Cleaned Windows-specific warnings and removed/quieted stale dead-code warnings.

### Removed
- **Deprecated Copilot injection entrypoint**: Removed unused legacy wrapper in favor of the unified instance-based switching pipeline.

---
## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **GitHub Copilot account management**: OAuth/Token/JSON import, quota status, plan badges, tags, batch actions, and account overview UI.
- **GitHub Copilot multi-instance**: Manage VS Code Copilot instances with isolated profiles, settings, and lifecycle actions.

### Changed
- **Dashboard & navigation**: Added GitHub Copilot entry and overview panel alongside Antigravity/Codex.
- **App-path behavior**: Rolled back the recent app-path re-detect changes to restore the previous detection flow.

### Fixed
- **Windows build warnings**: Tightened platform-specific process helpers and avoided moved environment values.

---
## [0.5.4] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Codex OAuth login session API**: Added command set `codex_oauth_login_start` / `codex_oauth_login_completed` / `codex_oauth_login_cancel` with `loginId + authUrl` response model.
- **OAuth timeout event contract**: Added backend timeout event payload (`loginId`, `callbackUrl`, `timeoutSeconds`) for frontend-driven retry UX.

### Changed
- **Codex OAuth flow alignment**: Switched from code-push completion to login-session completion (backend stores callback code by session, frontend completes by `loginId`).
- **UI authorization flow**: OAuth link is prepared and shown in modal first; browser open remains explicit user action.
- **Timeout retry UX**: On timeout, the main OAuth CTA switches to `Refresh authorization link`; after refresh succeeds, it switches back to `Open in Browser`.
- **Timeout behavior**: Timeout no longer triggers automatic authorization re-creation loops; retry is user-triggered.
- **OAuth observability**: Refined OAuth logs to concise operational checkpoints (session creation/start/timeout/cancel/complete), removing verbose full-payload noise.

### Removed
- **Legacy Codex OAuth commands**: Removed `prepare_codex_oauth_url`, `complete_codex_oauth`, `cancel_codex_oauth` and related frontend/service fallback paths.

### Fixed
- **Duplicate callback completion risk**: Hardened frontend callback handling with session and in-flight guards to reduce duplicate-complete races.
- **OAuth timeout UI duplication**: Resolved repeated timeout error presentation in modal by consolidating timeout-state rendering.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **Blank instance initialization mode**: Added a new initialization option when creating instances (`Copy source instance` / `Blank instance`) so users can create an empty directory without copying profile data.
- **Uninitialized-instance guide modal**: Clicking account binding on an uninitialized blank instance now opens a guide modal with a **Start now** action.
- **Instance sorting controls**: Added sort field selection (`Creation time` / `Launch time`) and ascending/descending toggle in the multi-instance toolbar.
- **In-app delete confirmation modal**: Instance deletion now uses an internal modal (with top-right close action) instead of relying on the system dialog.

### Changed
- **Instance status model**: Added `initialized` to Antigravity/Codex instance view payloads and wired it through frontend state.
- **Binding safety checks**: Binding is now blocked for uninitialized instances (disabled UI + backend validation with explicit error).
- **Instance list layout**: Status is shown in a dedicated column next to instance name; actions column is now sticky/opaque so it stays visible on narrow windows without content bleed-through.
- **Dropdown rendering split**: Inline list account dropdown renders via portal (outside container), while modal dropdown keeps in-container rendering to avoid clipping and style conflicts.
- **PID visibility rule**: PID is hidden when an instance is not running.
- **Post-start delayed refresh**: Added delayed refresh (~2s) after start to reduce stale `pending initialization` state after first boot.
- **i18n alignment**: Added and synchronized new instance-flow keys across all 17 locale files.

### Fixed
- **Delete-confirm freeze**: Fixed a scenario where delete confirmation actions could become unresponsive.

- **macOS launch strategy**: Prefer direct executable launch (PID available), fallback to `open -a` for `.app` paths.
- **App path reset**: Reset now auto-detects and fills the path instead of clearing it.
- **Account switching**: Update default instance PID after launch; emit app-path-missing events when needed.
- **Documentation**: Added multi-instance sections and image placeholders for Antigravity/Codex.
- **i18n**: Added new app-path related keys and ensured locale consistency.
