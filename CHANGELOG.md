# Changelog

English · [简体中文](CHANGELOG.zh-CN.md)

All notable changes to Cockpit Tools will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

---
## [0.8.4] - 2026-02-19

### Changed
- **Kiro JSON import now supports raw account snapshots**: The import pipeline now accepts Kiro-style raw JSON objects (and arrays) with fields like `accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `expiresAt`, `provider`, `profileArn`, and `usageData`, then maps them into normalized local accounts.
- **Kiro import parser is unified with OAuth snapshot mapping**: JSON import now reuses the same snapshot-to-payload extraction path as OAuth/local import, improving consistency of email/user/provider/plan/quota field parsing.

### Fixed
- **Slash datetime parsing for imported expiry**: Kiro token expiry values in `YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm:ss` format (e.g. `2026/02/19 02:01:47`) are now parsed correctly during import.
- **Bonus expiry fallback coverage**: `freeTrialExpiry` is now recognized as a fallback source when deriving Kiro add-on expiry days.

---
## [0.8.3] - 2026-02-18

### Changed
- **Tray platform matrix expanded with Kiro**: Added Kiro to tray platform ordering/display and account-count aggregation, and introduced Kiro account summary rendering in tray menus (plan + prompt/add-on remaining with reset time).
- **Legacy tray layout compatibility for Kiro rollout**: When loading old four-platform tray configs, Kiro is auto-appended only for legacy default layouts while preserving user-customized visibility/order.
- **Raw plan/tier labels enforced in account pages**: Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf account cards, tables, and filter options now show original plan/tier values directly (no localized remapping).

### Fixed
- **Auto-switch threshold boundary**: Account auto-switch trigger now fires when remaining percentage is less than or equal to threshold (`<=`) to avoid missing boundary cases at exact threshold.

---
## [0.8.2] - 2026-02-18

### Changed
- **OAuth callback server hardening**: Rewrote the local OAuth callback server to loop over incoming requests, silently ignoring non-callback requests (e.g. favicon), and only processing the actual `/oauth-callback` path. Added CORS preflight (OPTIONS) support and an explicit 404 response for unmatched routes.
- **OAuth CSRF protection**: OAuth authorization URL now includes a `state` parameter generated per flow; the callback server validates the returned state to prevent cross-site request forgery.
- **OAuth flow timeout & cleanup**: Added a configurable timeout for the OAuth callback wait; on timeout or failure the flow state is automatically cleaned up, and a user-facing retry message is returned.
- **OAuth redirect host normalization**: Changed OAuth redirect URI from `127.0.0.1` to `localhost` for broader browser/OS redirection compatibility.
- **Account identity matching overhaul**: Replaced the previous email-only account matching with a strict multi-factor identity matcher (`session_id` → `refresh_token` → `email + project_id`), plus a legacy single-email fallback for backward compatibility during upsert.
- **Google user ID persistence**: OAuth `UserInfo` now parses and stores the Google `id` field, writing it into account data on login completion.

---
## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-17

### Changed
- **Plan/Tier labels now use raw values**: Account-card and table badges across Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf/Kiro now display original backend/local plan values directly, while keeping existing style mapping.
- **Overview tabs use fixed default labels**: Platform overview tabs (`Account Overview` / `Multi-Instance`) now render default text directly to avoid cross-locale mismatch from platform-specific translation overrides.
- **Platform names are fixed to source labels**: Shared platform label rendering now always shows original platform names (`Antigravity`, `Codex`, `GitHub Copilot`, `Windsurf`, `Kiro`).
- **Codex switch behavior is configurable**: Added `codex_launch_on_switch` to backend/user config and wired it into Settings and Quick Settings so switching Codex can optionally skip auto launch/restart.

### Fixed
- **Dashboard privacy consistency**: Dashboard account emails are now masked by the same privacy toggle used in account/instance pages, with focus/visibility/storage sync to keep masking state consistent.
- **OpenCode switch-token sync reliability**: Fixed a regression where GPT account switching did not effectively replace OpenCode login credentials in runtime scenarios, causing the app session to stay on the previous account. (#51)
- **Dashboard card layout balance**: Fixed the Antigravity account card width behavior to avoid obvious right-side whitespace in dashboard layouts and improve visual balance. (#49)

---
## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **Fifth platform is live**: Kiro officially joins the supported platform lineup with unified management alongside Antigravity, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf.
- **Core Kiro flows are now available**: OAuth/Token/JSON/local import, account switching, quota refresh, multi-instance lifecycle, and app path configuration are all included.
- **Platform-layer refactor**: Instance services, account stores, and overview tabs were unified into reusable platform abstractions to reduce future integration cost.
- **Key fixes in this release**: Hardened Kiro import ID validation against path traversal and filled missing locale keys to reduce mixed-language fallback in non-default locales.

---
## [0.7.3] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Tray platform layout persistence**: Added backend tray layout config storage (`tray_layout.json`) and command `save_tray_platform_layout` to save tray visibility, order, and sort mode.
- **Tray visibility control in layout modal**: Added `Show in tray` toggle in platform layout management and synchronized the related locale key across supported languages.
- **Expanded tray platform coverage**: Added GitHub Copilot and Windsurf tray submenus with account/quota summary and direct navigation targets.

### Changed
- **Tray menu architecture**: Refactored tray menu generation to dynamic multi-platform rendering, supporting auto/manual ordering and overflow grouping (`More platforms`).
- **Tray refresh trigger points**: GitHub Copilot/Windsurf refresh, OAuth completion, token import, and account switch flows now refresh tray content immediately; language changes also trigger tray rebuild.
- **Frontend tray event handling**: `tray:refresh_quota` now refreshes Antigravity, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf in one flow; tray navigation now recognizes `github-copilot` and `windsurf`.
- **Platform layout sync strategy**: Added debounced frontend-to-backend tray layout sync on reorder/visibility changes and on initial app load.

### Fixed
- **Tray visibility filtering correctness**: Fixed tray platform filtering so disabled platforms remain hidden and the empty-state item appears when no tray platform is selected.
- **Log privacy hardening**: Logger now masks email addresses in log messages to reduce exposure of sensitive identifiers.

---
## [0.7.2] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Group management "Other Models" bucket**: Added an auto-collected `Other Models` group that lists non-default models discovered from account quotas.
- **Auth-mode model blacklist filtering**: Added blacklist filtering by model ID/display name in group management to exclude blocked Gemini 2.5/chat variants.
- **Claude Opus 4.6 mapping coverage**: Added `claude-opus-4-6-thinking` and `MODEL_PLACEHOLDER_M26` to default/recommended model mappings and wakeup recommendations.

### Changed
- **Group settings migration behavior**: Loading group settings now incrementally backfills missing default mappings/names/order while preserving user custom configuration.
- **Group modal data source**: Accounts page now passes live model IDs/display names into group management, improving model label display and "other model" classification accuracy.
- **Model display order alignment**: Account quota display order was aligned to include Claude Opus 4.6 under the Claude group.

### Fixed
- **Locale completeness for group settings**: Synchronized `group_settings.other_group` across all supported locales to avoid missing-key fallbacks.

---
## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Cross-platform quota alert workflow**: Added quota alert calculations and event dispatch for Antigravity, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf, with per-platform model/credit metric detection.
- **Quota alert settings surface**: Added quota alert enable/threshold controls in both Settings and Quick Settings, with synchronized i18n keys.
- **Global modal infrastructure**: Added reusable global modal store/hook/component (`useGlobalModal` + Zustand + `GlobalModal`) for cross-module prompts and alert actions.
- **Notification capability integration**: Integrated Tauri notification capability in app runtime/capabilities with macOS click-to-focus handling.

### Changed
- **Quota refresh behavior**: Refresh-all and refresh-current flows for Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf now trigger quota-alert checks after successful quota/token refresh.
- **Alert payload model**: `quota:alert` payload now carries `platform`, and the frontend modal quick-switch action now routes to the correct platform switch flow/page.
- **Settings input interaction**: Refresh interval and threshold controls now use preset + inline numeric input mode with Enter/blur apply behavior.
- **Config model propagation**: `quota_alert_enabled` and `quota_alert_threshold` are now persisted through command save/get and websocket language-save paths.
- **Log retention policy**: Logger initialization now cleans up expired `app.log*` files older than 3 days.

### Fixed
- **Quota alert listener lifecycle**: Prevented duplicate `quota:alert` subscriptions caused by async unlisten timing in React effect cleanup.
- **Threshold consistency at 0%**: Runtime threshold normalization now honors `0%`, matching frontend options and user expectations.

---
## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **Settings model extension**: General settings now include Windsurf auto-refresh and app-path controls, plus corresponding quick-settings behavior.
- **Windows path detection pipeline**: App detection was upgraded with stronger multi-source probing, PowerShell `-File` fallback, and VS Code registry probing.

### Fixed
- **Path detection reliability on Windows**: Improved handling for empty/error-prone command output and reduced false-miss cases during VS Code/Windsurf path discovery.
- **Quota refresh fallback behavior**: Failed refresh now preserves the last valid quota snapshot to avoid clearing displayed quota to zeros.
- **Switch/injection robustness**: Improved handling and diagnostics around account binding and startup path mismatch cases.

---
## [0.6.10] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **Privacy mode for screenshots**: Added Eye/EyeOff toggle and masking for email-like identifiers in Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot account overviews and instance pages.
- **GitHub Copilot one-click switching pipeline**: Added default-profile VS Code switching path with token injection and restart integration.

- **Quota/switch diagnostics**: Added richer runtime logs and metadata outputs for refresh/switch troubleshooting.
- **Codex multi-team identity support**: Added account matching based on `account_id`/`organization_id` to support multi-team scenarios.
- **macOS distribution postflight hook**: Added Cask postflight logic to auto-remove quarantine attributes.
- **Release process templates/scripts**: Added release checklist/docs and helper scripts for preflight validation and checksum generation.

### Changed
- **Unified switch flow (overview -> default instance)**: Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot overview switching now follows default-instance startup logic (PID-targeted close -> inject -> start).
- **GitHub Copilot flow alignment**: Overview switching and multi-instance startup now share the same injection/start semantics.
- **Instance lifecycle alignment**: Unified start/stop/close behavior across Antigravity/Codex/VS Code with managed-directory matching and PID tracking.
- **Windows VS Code launch strategy**: Switched to `cmd /C code` for `.cmd` wrapper compatibility.
- **PID resolution semantics alignment**: VS Code PID resolving/focus now uses `Option<&str>` semantics (`None` => default instance), matching Antigravity behavior and reducing default-instance mismatch edge cases.
- **Docs and settings guidance**: Updated README/security/settings guidance for new switching and path behaviors.
- **Localization synchronization**: Updated locale keys across all supported languages for Copilot switching, open-window action, privacy mode, and related error messages.

### Fixed
- **Error compatibility and messaging**: Improved non-success status handling paths and user-facing error propagation for refresh/switch operations.
- **PR review follow-ups**: Improved error handling, added SQLite transaction safeguards in injection flow, and fixed branding inconsistencies.
- **Build hygiene**: Cleaned Windows-specific warnings and removed/quieted stale dead-code warnings.

### Removed
- **Deprecated Copilot injection entrypoint**: Removed unused legacy wrapper in favor of the unified instance-based switching pipeline.

---
## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-08

---
## [0.5.4] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Codex OAuth login session API**: Added command set `codex_oauth_login_start` / `codex_oauth_login_completed` / `codex_oauth_login_cancel` with `loginId + authUrl` response model.
- **OAuth timeout event contract**: Added backend timeout event payload (`loginId`, `callbackUrl`, `timeoutSeconds`) for frontend-driven retry UX.

### Changed
- **Codex OAuth flow alignment**: Switched from code-push completion to login-session completion (backend stores callback code by session, frontend completes by `loginId`).
- **UI authorization flow**: OAuth link is prepared and shown in modal first; browser open remains explicit user action.
- **Timeout retry UX**: On timeout, the main OAuth CTA switches to `Refresh authorization link`; after refresh succeeds, it switches back to `Open in Browser`.
- **Timeout behavior**: Timeout no longer triggers automatic authorization re-creation loops; retry is user-triggered.
- **OAuth observability**: Refined OAuth logs to concise operational checkpoints (session creation/start/timeout/cancel/complete), removing verbose full-payload noise.

### Removed
- **Legacy Codex OAuth commands**: Removed `prepare_codex_oauth_url`, `complete_codex_oauth`, `cancel_codex_oauth` and related frontend/service fallback paths.

### Fixed
- **Duplicate callback completion risk**: Hardened frontend callback handling with session and in-flight guards to reduce duplicate-complete races.
- **OAuth timeout UI duplication**: Resolved repeated timeout error presentation in modal by consolidating timeout-state rendering.

---
## [0.5.3] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **Blank instance initialization mode**: Added a new initialization option when creating instances (`Copy source instance` / `Blank instance`) so users can create an empty directory without copying profile data.
- **Uninitialized-instance guide modal**: Clicking account binding on an uninitialized blank instance now opens a guide modal with a **Start now** action.
- **Instance sorting controls**: Added sort field selection (`Creation time` / `Launch time`) and ascending/descending toggle in the multi-instance toolbar.
- **In-app delete confirmation modal**: Instance deletion now uses an internal modal (with top-right close action) instead of relying on the system dialog.

### Changed
- **Instance status model**: Added `initialized` to Antigravity/Codex instance view payloads and wired it through frontend state.
- **Binding safety checks**: Binding is now blocked for uninitialized instances (disabled UI + backend validation with explicit error).
- **Instance list layout**: Status is shown in a dedicated column next to instance name; actions column is now sticky/opaque so it stays visible on narrow windows without content bleed-through.
- **Dropdown rendering split**: Inline list account dropdown renders via portal (outside container), while modal dropdown keeps in-container rendering to avoid clipping and style conflicts.
- **PID visibility rule**: PID is hidden when an instance is not running.
- **Post-start delayed refresh**: Added delayed refresh (~2s) after start to reduce stale `pending initialization` state after first boot.
- **i18n alignment**: Added and synchronized new instance-flow keys across all 17 locale files.

### Fixed
- **Delete-confirm freeze**: Fixed a scenario where delete confirmation actions could become unresponsive.

### Added
- **Wakeup scheduler backend sync**: Added scheduler sync command and backend-side history load/clear APIs.
- **Download directory helper**: Exposed a system API to resolve the downloads directory.
- **App path management**: Added Codex app path to general settings and introduced app-path detect/set commands.

### Changed
- **Wakeup history storage**: Moved history persistence to backend storage with higher retention (up to 100 items).
- **macOS launch strategy**: Prefer direct executable launch (PID available), fallback to `open -a` for `.app` paths.
- **App path reset**: Reset now auto-detects and fills the path instead of clearing it.
- **Account switching**: Update default instance PID after launch; emit app-path-missing events when needed.
- **Documentation**: Added multi-instance sections and image placeholders for Antigravity/Codex.
- **i18n**: Added new app-path related keys and ensured locale consistency.
